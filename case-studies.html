            <h2>Historical Background</h2>
            <p>For millennia, Native American food systems, passed through the generations and rooted in a deep understanding of the land, sustained culture and nourished communities. Each system was molded and shaped to the unique ecological conditions of the area, and together, they encompassed a vast range of practices and foods.</p>
            
            <p>Yet today, food insecurity affects ~25% of Native Americans. In fact, between 2010 and 2020, Native American communities faced food insecurity rates roughly 2-3 times higher than those of white Americans (Blue Bird Jernigan et al., 2021). Food prices on many reservations are also significantly greater than national averages (First Nations Development Institute, 2018). Moreover, ~48% of Native American adults are obese and ~24% have diabetesâ€”almost 4x the rate of non-Hispanic white population (Maillcheruvu, 2022). Below, I outline some of the key historical factors behind this crisis.</p>

                <h3>Land Displacement and Dispossession</h3>
                <div class="case-content">
                    <p>Policies such as the Indian Removal Act of 1830 forced many tribes from their homelands. Eastern tribes were displaced further and further west, often to places where their traditional food procurement methods were impossible to maintain (Hibbeler et al., 2025). Indeed, these forced relocations cut long-established ties between Native Americans and their sense of place and food sources. They also laid the groundwork for the establishment of reservations.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Dawes Allotment Act of 1887 further reduced Native American land holdings by fragmenting them into 160-acre parcels and declaring "surplus" lands as available for settlement. By 1934, ~90 million acres of Native land were lost through this process.</p>

                <h3>Prohibition of Traditional Land Management</h3>
                <div class="case-content">
                    <p>Many tribes had sophisticated methods for managing landscapes to enhance food production. For instance, the Karuk tribe employed controlled burning in order to promote growth of acorns, huckleberries, and other traditional foods whilst also creating habitat for game. Federal policies prohibited such practices, further restricting food sovereignty (Sowerwine et al., 2019).</p>

                <h3>Assimilation</h3>
                <div class="case-content">
                    <p>The Civilization Act of 1819 funded programs to assimilate Native Americans into European culture. It established the foundation for later broader assimilationist policies such as the federal Indian boarding school campaign (Hibbeler et al., 2025). As part of this, the US government removed Native American children from their homes. At the boarding schools, they were fed high-starch and simple sugar foods such as cornmeal mush, bread, and molasses. For many, this entirely replaced traditional ways of eating (Maillacheruvu, 2022).</p>

                <h3>Federal Food Distribution</h3>
                <div class="case-content">
                    <p>Since the 1800s, the US federal government has distributed rations to Native Americans to fulfill treaty obligations. Again, the rations in question were often low-quality and contained foods that were foreign to Native American diets, such as wheat flour and lard. In 1973, the federal government formalized this system as the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR). FDPIR carried on the problematic legacy of prior initiatives until the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill, a major piece of federal legislation. For the first time, tribes could use self-determination contracts to buy food directly from Native producers, enabling them to reincorporate traditional foods into their diets.</p>
