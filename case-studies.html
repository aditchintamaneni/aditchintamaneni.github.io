            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>For millennia, Native American food systems, passed through the generations and rooted in a deep understanding of the land, sustained culture and nourished communities. Each system was molded and shaped to the unique ecological conditions of the area, and together, they encompassed a vast range of practices and foods.</p>
            
            <p>Yet today, food insecurity affects ~25% of Native Americans. In fact, between 2010 and 2020, Native American communities faced food insecurity rates roughly 2-3 times higher than those of white Americans (Blue Bird Jernigan et al., 2021). Food prices on many reservations are also significantly higher than national averages (First Nations Development Institute, 2018). Moreover, ~48% of Native American adults are obese and ~24% have diabetesâ€”almost 4x the rate of non-Hispanic white population (Maillcheruvu, 2022). Below, I outline some of the key historical factors behind this crisis.</p>

                <h3>Land Displacement and Dispossession</h3>
                <div class="case-content">
                    <p>Policies such as the Indian Removal Act of 1830 forced many tribes from their homelands. Eastern tribes were displaced further and further west, often to places where their traditional food procurement methods were impossible to maintain (Hibbeler et al., 2025). Indeed, these forced relocations cut long-established ties between Native Americans and their sense of place and food sources. They also laid the groundwork for the establishment of reservations.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Dawes Allotment Act of 1887 further reduced Native American land holdings by fragmenting them into 160-acre parcels and declaring "surplus" lands as available for settlement. By 1934, ~90 million acres of Native land were lost through this process.</p>

                <h3>Prohibition of Traditional Land Management</h3>
                <div class="case-content">
                    <p>Many tribes had sophisticated methods for managing landscapes to enhance food production. For instance, the Karuk tribe employed controlled burning in order to promote growth of acorns, huckleberries, and other traditional foods whilst also creating habitat for game. Federal policies prohibited such practices, further restricting food sovereignty (Sowerwine et al., 2019).</p>

                <h3>Assimilation</h3>
                <div class="case-content">
                    <p>The Civilization Act of 1819 funded programs to assimilate Native Americans into European culture. It established the foundation for later broader assimilationist policies such as the federal Indian boarding school campaign (Hibbeler et al., 2025). As part of this, the US government removed Native American children from their homes. At the boarding schools, they were fed high-starch and simple sugar foods such as cornmeal mush, bread, and molasses. For many, this entirely replaced traditional ways of eating (Maillacheruvu, 2022).</p>

                <h3>Federal Food Distribution</h3>
                <div class="case-content">
                    <p>Since the 1800s, the US federal government has distributed rations to Native Americans to fulfill treaty obligations. Again, the rations in question were often low-quality and contained foods that were foreign to Native American diets, such as wheat flour and lard. In 1973, the federal government formalized this system as the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR). FDPIR carried on the problematic legacy of prior initiatives until the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill, a major piece of federal legislation. For the first time, tribes could use self-determination contracts to buy food directly from Native producers, enabling them to reincorporate traditional foods into their diets. The bill initially allocated $5 million for the FDPIR Self-Determination Demonstration Project. However, implementation was delayed to 2021 when the USDA released $3.5 million to eight tribal nations (Maillacheruvu, 2022). By early 2024, the program included 16 tribes across nine states with $10.1 million of total funding (Huber, 2024).

                <h3>Leveraging Self-Determination</h3>
                <div class="case-content">
                    <p>The Oneida Nation in Wisconsin, one of the first eight tribes selected to pilot the FDPIR Self-Determination Demonstration Project, has fundamentally transformed how federal food assistance operates in their community. They now:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Control their own food procurement process directly</li>
                        <li>Source buffalo and beef raised on their own 65,000-acre reservation</li>
                        <li>Create a consistent market for foods grown by Native producers</li>
                        <li>Distribute these culturally appropriate foods to both Oneida members and the neighboring Menominee Indian Tribe</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This approach redirects federal dollars that previously flowed to outside food suppliers back into the Native economy whilst also providing foods that reflect Oneida cultural traditions. "This is all rooted in our identity as Oneida people", states Vanessa Miller, the tribe's food and agriculture area manager. "We're empowering our communities and ourselves by taking our health into our hands" (Huber, 2024).</p>
                    <p>In fact, the success of this project has already prompted the Oneida farm to augment its herds, creating a positive feedback loop of increased production, employment, and food sovereignty.</p>

                <h3>Revitalizing Knowledge Systems</h3>
                <div class="case-content">
                    <p>In Michigan, The Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians focuses on restoring not just access to traditional foods, but also the knowledge systems essential to preparing and appreciating them. Their approach addresses both supply and education.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Supply:</strong> Through a self-determination contract, they source walleye, a traditional Anishinaabe food, from another tribe. Their FDPIR warehouse distribution center is designed as a grocery store, representing a paradigm shift from passively receiving assistance to employing agency.</li>
                        <li><strong>Education:</strong> Through the Healthy Native Foods Project, they have created cooking videos and recipe cards demonstrating traditional preparation methods for foods in their FDPIR packages.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Joe Van Alstine, regional FDPIR director and tribal citizen, frames this as fundamental to sovereignty: "We know where we can go get [traditional] food. We know who's producing it to our style" (Martinchek et al., 2023).</p>

                <h3>Facilitating Intergenerational Learning</h3>
                <div class="case-content">
                    <p>Using traditional ecological knowledge, the Karuk Tribe takes an educational approach to food sovereignty. In collaboration with Berkeley, they produced:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Nanu'Ã¡vaha ("Our Food") curriculum with 89 lesson plans adopted by three public school districts</li>
                        <li>One of only three tribal herbaria in the United States, preserving plant knowledge</li>
                        <li>Regular workshops and seasonal food camps that have reached thousands of tribal members</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This educational infrastructure addresses the knowledge disruption created by assimilation policies and connects younger generations to their food heritage. 95% of parents surveyed expressed support, many noting their children's enthusiasm for harvesting native foods introduced in the sessions (Sowerwine et al., 2019).</p>
