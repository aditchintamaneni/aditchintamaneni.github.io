            <p class="section-description">
                I used the <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-access-research-atlas/documentation" target="_blank">USDA Food Access Research Atlas (FARA) Dataset</a> to conduct a geospatial analysis of food access disparities across Native American communities and surrounding areas in California. The USDA gives four definitions of "Low-Access" Census Tracts:

            <div class="definition-box">
                <ol class="definition-list">
                    <li>Low-income census tracts where a significant number (at least 500 people) or share (at least 33 percent) of the population is greater than one-half mile from the nearest supermarket, supercenter, or large grocery store for an urban area or greater than 10 miles for a rural area. Using this measure, an estimated 53.6 million people, or 17.4 percent of the U.S. population, live in tracts that are low-income and low access and are more than one-half mile or 10 miles from the nearest supermarket.</li>
                    
                    <li>Low-income census tracts where a significant number (at least 500 people) or share (at least 33 percent) of the population is greater than 1 mile from the nearest supermarket, supercenter, or large grocery store for an urban area or greater than 10 miles for a rural area. This measure shows that an estimated 18.8 million people, or 6.1 percent of the U.S. population, live in low-income and low access tracts and are more than 1 mile or 10 miles from a supermarket.</li>
                    
                    <li>Low-income census tracts where a significant number (at least 500 people) or share (at least 33 percent) of the population is greater than 1 mile from the nearest supermarket, supercenter, or large grocery store for an urban area or greater than 20 miles for a rural area. Under this measure, an estimated 17.1 million people, or 5.6 percent of the U.S. population, live in low-income and low access tracts and are more than 1 mile or 20 miles from a supermarket.</li>
                    
                    <li>A fourth and slightly more complex measure incorporates vehicle access directly into the measure, delineating low-income tracts where a significant number of households are located far from a supermarket and do not have access to a vehicle. This measure also includes census tracts with populations that are so remote, that even with a vehicle, driving to a supermarket may be considered a burden because of the great distance.</li>

                The FARA data is based on a 2019 list of supermarkets, the 2010 Census, and the 2014-2018 American Community Survey. To conduct my analysis, I joined in 2010 California and American Indian/Alaska Native/Native Hawaiian Area (AIANNHA) boundary files. <a href="https://ofm.wa.gov/sites/default/files/public/legacy/pop/geographic/tiger10/metadata/tribal10.html" target="_blank">The AIANNH boundary files</a> include boundaries for federal and state-recognized American Indian reservations/off-reservation trust land areas, federal and state tribal designated statistical areas, and joint use areas. For the purposes of my analysis, I have classified them all as "Tribal Areas". My code can be found <a href = "fara_analysis.html"> here</a>.

                    <p>This map visualizes the percentage of households without vehicle access across California census tracts. I calculated this by simply dividing the # of tract housing units without a vehicle by the total # of tract housing units. Unfortunately the FARA data derives the value in the numerator from the 2014-2018 ACS and the value in the denominator from 2010 US Census. This resulted in some percentages being over 100%! I capped the colorbar at 50% for ease of visualization.</p>

            <p class="section-description">
                In addition to physical access to food retailers, price disparities represent another significant barrier to food sovereignty in Native American communities. I aggregated data from the "Indian Country Food Price Index: Exploring Variation in Food Pricing Across Native Communities - A Working Paper II," published by First Nations Development Institute in 2018, into a CSV file. This study collected monthly food prices from December 2016 through November 2017 across 40 Native American communities. Researchers gathered price data for a consistent basket of food items, such as milk, bread, coffee, and chicken, from various retail outlets. Locally collected prices were then systematically compared against national average prices provided by the Consumer Index Bureau of Labor Statistics for Urban Consumers to identify and quantify disparities.

                    <p>I chose to visualize the average prices of foods sold on reservations compared to their national averages. For more detailed insights at the state level, I recommend exploring the Food Price Index. Notably, for every data point, food prices on reservations were consistently higher than the national average.</p>
