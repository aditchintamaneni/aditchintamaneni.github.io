            <h2>USDA Food Access Research Atlas Analysis</h2>
            <p class="section-description">
                I used the <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-access-research-atlas/documentation" target="_blank">USDA Food Access Research Atlas (FARA) Dataset</a> to conduct a geospatial analysis of food access disparities across Native American communities and surrounding areas in California. The USDA gives four definitions of "Low-Access" Census Tracts:

            <div class="definition-box">
                <ol class="definition-list">
                    <li>Low-income census tracts where a significant number (at least 500 people) or share (at least 33 percent) of the population is greater than one-half mile from the nearest supermarket, supercenter, or large grocery store for an urban area or greater than 10 miles for a rural area. Using this measure, an estimated 53.6 million people, or 17.4 percent of the U.S. population, live in tracts that are low-income and low access and are more than one-half mile or 10 miles from the nearest supermarket.</li>
                    
                    <li>Low-income census tracts where a significant number (at least 500 people) or share (at least 33 percent) of the population is greater than 1 mile from the nearest supermarket, supercenter, or large grocery store for an urban area or greater than 10 miles for a rural area. This measure shows that an estimated 18.8 million people, or 6.1 percent of the U.S. population, live in low-income and low access tracts and are more than 1 mile or 10 miles from a supermarket.</li>
                    
                    <li>Low-income census tracts where a significant number (at least 500 people) or share (at least 33 percent) of the population is greater than 1 mile from the nearest supermarket, supercenter, or large grocery store for an urban area or greater than 20 miles for a rural area. Under this measure, an estimated 17.1 million people, or 5.6 percent of the U.S. population, live in low-income and low access tracts and are more than 1 mile or 20 miles from a supermarket.</li>
                    
                    <li>A fourth and slightly more complex measure incorporates vehicle access directly into the measure, delineating low-income tracts where a significant number of households are located far from a supermarket and do not have access to a vehicle. This measure also includes census tracts with populations that are so remote, that even with a vehicle, driving to a supermarket may be considered a burden because of the great distance.</li>

                The FARA data is based on a 2019 list of supermarkets, the 2010 Census, and the 2014-2018 American Community Survey. To conduct my analysis, I joined in 2010 California and American Indian/Alaska Native/Native Hawaiian Area (AIANNHA) boundary files. <a href="https://ofm.wa.gov/sites/default/files/public/legacy/pop/geographic/tiger10/metadata/tribal10.html" target="_blank">The AIANNH boundary files</a> include boundaries for federal and state-recognized American Indian reservations/off-reservation trust land areas, federal and state tribal designated statistical areas, and joint use areas. For the purposes of my analysis, I have classified them all as "Tribal Areas".

                    <p>This map visualizes the percentage of households without vehicle access across California census tracts. I calculated this by simply dividing the # of tract housing units without a vehicle by the total # of tract housing units. Unfortunately the FARA data derives the value in the numerator from the 2014-2018 ACS and the value in the denominator from 2010 US Census. This resulted in some percentages being over 100%! I hope to resolve this by replacing the total # of tract housing units with the ACS estimate. I capped the colorbar at 50% for ease of visualization.</p>
